Dear Keith,

How are you? (I am still getting used to my new heart medication).
I thought the end of the psalm for this Sunday was particularly appropriate
for our situations:

When they call to me, I will answer them;
I will be with them in trouble,
I will rescue them and honour them,
and show them my salvation.

It is my hope and prayer that your recovery is free from viccissitudes,
I hope that you are feeling better soon...

I hope you are out of Hospital soon!!!

Blessings, Frank.
