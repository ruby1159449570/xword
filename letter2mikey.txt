Dear Michael,

How are you? (I am still getting over this rotten cold).
Sorry to hear of your viccissitudes, I hope that you are feeling better
soon...

I worked two shifts at ETIHAD stadium on the weekend,
I was pretty tired by the end of it; I saw the movie "Source Code"
Kind of like "Groundhog Day" meets "Wargames"...

I hope you are out of Hospital soon!!!

Love, Frank.
